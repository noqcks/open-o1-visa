# Appendix E: The Visa Interview

If you’re not a Canadian, there’s one final challenge that you need to surmount, which is the O1 visa interview.

It is important to note that this is not a rubber-stamping process. The purpose of the interview is to thoroughly evaluate your qualifications and the authenticity of your application. To ensure success, it is crucial that you come well-prepared, bringing all necessary documentation and being ready to discuss your extraordinary abilities and achievements in detail.

The consular officer will carefully examine your case to ensure that you meet the high standards required for the O-1 visa. Therefore, thorough preparation and clear, confident communication are essential.

It is possible for applicants to be denied during their visa interview, so it is important to be prepared. Approach the interview as a conversation with the visa interviewer, rather than treating them as a robot. It is important to keep in mind that most visa interviewers may not be well-trained or have expertise in your field. Therefore, it is best to speak to them using simple, non-condescending language, just as you would when speaking to someone who is not familiar with your field.

You should try to anticipate the types of questions that the immigration officer may ask about your background, qualifications, and intentions in the United States.

The visa interview usually lasts only 5 or 10 minutes. It is essentially a pitch where you need to present why you qualify for the O1 visa. Your story should sound coherent and impressive.

The immigration officers expect that if you are someone who is unique and exceptional, with national or international acclaim, you will speak confidently and clearly like someone who is exceptional! The visa interview is not the time to be shy when explaining your background and expertise. You need to confidently highlight your achievements and tell the visa officer how awesome you are.

If you come from a country with a high B1/B2 visa refusal rate, this interview is especially important. In these countries, immigration officers will scrutinize your application intensely.

It can also be helpful if you come from a country like India, Nigeria, or any country bordering Russia to provide proof of your ties to your home country, if possible. Items such as an apartment lease, proof of home ownership, or evidence of having a spouse and children living in your home country can all be beneficial.
