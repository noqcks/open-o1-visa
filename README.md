# Welcome

:wave: Hello! My name is Benji -- im an entrepreneur and YC Alumni.&#x20;



In 2023 I needed an O1 for a startup I was working on, I found the process to be extremely confusing. I was finally approved after my second O1 attempt. Hooray!



This book outlines all the information I wish I had in 2023.
