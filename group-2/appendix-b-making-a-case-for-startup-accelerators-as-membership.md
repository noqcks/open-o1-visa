# Appendix B: Making a case for startup accelerators as Membership

Some people have reported that they were not able to meet the criteria for memberships by including a startup accelerator.

The main thing you’ll need to highlight is the selection criteria for the startup accelerator.

Here’s an example of Y Combinator membership argument.

> The Beneficiary was selected as a member of this prestigious international accelerator and founders’ network out of thousands of applicants where the acceptance rate was less than 2%.

> In the field of technology entrepreneurship, being accepted into a top accelerator or incubator program, such as Y Combinator (YC), is considered an elite membership. Only individuals with outstanding achievements in the field are granted membership into YC. The Beneficiary’s membership in YC is a reflection of his extraordinary ability in the field of technology entrepreneurship.

> Evidence
>
> * Expert Testimonial Letter from a Managing Partner at Y Combinator, describing its membership criteria and explaining why the Beneficiary was granted membership
> * Information about YC, its mission, acceptance criteria, and selection process
> * Data from Seed Accelerator Rankings Project, which objectively reviewed startup associations and designated YC with a top ‘Platinum-Plus’ rating
> * Independent article from Forbes, which states Y Combinator as a Top 3 global association which accepts only 1-2% out of thousands of annual applicant Founders

You need to convince USCIS that the startup accelerator you were accepted into has a highly selective admission process, demonstrating its significance among other accelerators. Additionally, mentioning other successful startups or founders who have been part of this accelerator can further strengthen your case.

> Some of the highly accomplished startup founders that are included in this membership include Sam Altman, Gary Tan, etc, etc.
